We collected insects at light traps in Eastern MA, USA along an urban-to-rural gradient in Summer 2025. We are investigating the impacts of urbanization and light pollution on flight-to-light behavior.

Step 1. Data cleaning in R (can skip this and go to step 2).
We used data from our fieldwork in Summer 2025 that describes how many insects were caught in light traps for approximately 2 hours after sunset. We also measured canopy cover, percent developed land in a surrounding area, and several other environmental variables. We combined these sheets and also added data for several solar/lunar variables (e.g. twilight illumination and moon phase from msmielak's moonlit package.

Step 2. Data analysis in R (start here)
After step 1 where we merge all of the data into a single spreadsheet, we can begin to process our data in data.longer.csv to analyze it in R and assess the difference in flight-to-light behavior along our gradient and how it is altered by different environmental conditions.
